        <p>Hi, I’m Charlie. I’m from Springfield, Missouri. I am a senior at Mizzou. I am in the
            Environmental Science program, on track to graduate in 2024. I love the environment
            and doing whatever I can to protect the natural world. My volunteer time at the World
            Wildlife Fund (WWF) has taught me we still have <em>much</em> to learn and teach about climate
            change. <br/>
            In the future, I hope to shape environmentalist policy that will appeal to both
            consumer <strong>and</strong> business. For fun, I enjoy reading and gaming. I also love traveling and
            hiking. Seeing new parts of the world and taking in their natural beauty motivates me to
            preserve the planet, through both my own action <em>and</em> helping others through theirs.</p>
