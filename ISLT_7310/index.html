        <h4>Welcome to Green Eco, a website committed to environmental education. </h4>
        <p>At GreenEco, our mission is simply to inspire. We believe climate change is the most
            important issue of our time. The concept: produce easy-to-digest information about
            climate change. Then, provide you with solutions for both individual action and effective
            policy. Our hope is that we can teach the everyday person the basics of
            sustainability in an appealing manner while simultaneously capturing your interest. <br>We strive to
            present a wide array of information, and want everyone who comes here to leave at
            least a little more learned, but significantly more inspired and driven. Our goal is to combat the apathy
            and despair that many feel with regards to environmentalism. But if you leave our website with just
            one thing in mind for the betterment of our world, then we consider our mission a success.</p>
