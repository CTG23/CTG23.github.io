        <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
        <p>
            Climate change: the defining issue of our time. The term climate change refers to the gradual increase 
            in the Earth's temperature over the past couple of centuries. While the Earth's temperature 
            has risen and fallen naturally over the course of its existence, the rise we are currently
            experiencing is proven to be caused by human activity. The warming of the earth does not just mean
            our summers are hotter. The natural world we occupy is a remarkably delicate and
            balanced scale after millions of years of evolution across millions of species. The slightest tip, 
            such as higher temperatures or rising sea levels, can throw this entire system off balance and put the
            condition of our ecosystems in danger: ecosystems that you and I rely on every single day.

        <h3>Feasible, Worthwhile Individual Action for the Present.</h3>
        <p>
            With regards to environmentalism, many fall into pitfalls of despair and apathy. Striving to take the smallest, easiest changes is the most feasible way for an 
            individual to have an effective and positive impact. It is unrealistic to expect one individual to be a hero and adopt a radically different lifestyle. 
            This isn't necessary yet: these small individual actions, when performed as a collective, significant change will be brought about. After all, it is for 
            the sake of future generations. This section will explore a variety of climate-positive actions. See which ones may work best for you.

        <h3>Effective Policy Shaping for the Future</h3>
        <figure class="hydro"> </figure>
        <p>
            Collaborative effort through our own individual action is great, but some of the most
            effective change will come through policy. 100 corporations account for over 70% of
            worldwide emissions, most of them dealing in oil or natural gas. It is on governments to
            hold them accountable and demand environmentally sustainable practice. Due to action
            like the Paris Agreements, companies have signaled to adopt such practices. Tax
            subsidies to renewables and electric vehicles, such as those from the Inflation
            Reduction Act, will expedite the phase-out of nonrenewables, the source of the problem
            in the first place. This page will show how governments, from the federal to local level,
            have contributed and further action that can be taken.
